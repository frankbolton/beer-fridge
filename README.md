Beer Fridge Controller

First built in 2013 as a way to use a fridge that was left in my apartment to brew ginger beer. 
It has a stupid simple hysteresis controller (bang bang).

The arduino and solid state relay are mounted inside of a multiplug with the LCD visible.
At some stage the LCD Failed, so I used a Nexus 7 tablet and USB OTG to check on the temperature.
