Beer Fridge Controller

First built in 2013 as a way to use a fridge that was left in my apartment to brew ginger beer. 
It has a stupid simple hysteresis controller (bang bang).

The arduino and solid state relay are mounted inside of a multiplug with the LCD visible.
At some stage the LCD Failed, so I used a Nexus 7 tablet and USB OTG to check on the temperature.

Older commits deal with this

The second revision takes place in 2016. I'm now a married man who bought a fridge specifically 
for fermentation. This versuion once again relies on an Arduino Uno, a DS120 temperature sensor, 
a Sainsmart LCD Keypad shield and an El-cheapo SSR.
